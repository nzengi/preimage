# Hash Attack&Key Recovery Project

## Introduction
This project aims to recover a private key corresponding to a specific Bitcoin address by using **zenimage** on hash functions. The project implements parallel processing and preimage attacks on hash functions, utilizing C++ to optimize performance.

## Features
- **Hash Functions:** Utilizes RIPEMD-160 and SHA-256 hash functions.
- **Parallel Processing:** Uses OpenMP to leverage multi-core CPUs for faster processing.
- **Preimage Attack:** Systematically searches for a private key by finding the preimage of a given hash.
